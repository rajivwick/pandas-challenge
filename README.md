# pandas-challenge
In this assignment, we created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyse school and standardised test data.


With results obtained during this analyses, we can point to two observational trends. 

1. Schools with less than 1000 students displayed higher averages in Math and Reading, also in students passing both disciplines and overall (passing maths and reading). 
We can see in our scored by total students table (sizeGroup) as we go down the rows and increase the number of students, the average number of students passing in all areas reduces as well as the average score. This theme might suggest that schools with less students are performing better due to teachers having more time per student than larger schools. however to prove this thesis we would need to obtain data on the number of teachers per school. 

2. Schools that had a budget per student of $585-$630 out performed all the other schools with budgets greater or smaller. This looks like a significant category to explore as it may indicate a 'sweet spot' for budgeting on future school spending. 

3.Even though we sort out to search for two trends, a third is visible. Independent schools out performed government schools in Maths, Reading and the total average of students passing Maths, Reading and overall (passing both Maths and Reading)
