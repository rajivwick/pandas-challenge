# Analysis

I create and transformed Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized the data.

With results obtained during this analysis, two observational trends can be derived. 

1. Schools with less than 1000 students displayed higher averages in Math and Reading, also in students passing both disciplines and overall (passing maths and reading). 
We can see in our scored by total students table (sizeGroup) as we go down the rows and increase the number of students, the average number of students passing in all areas reduces as well as the average score. This theme might suggest that schools with less students are performing better due to teachers having more time per student than larger schools. however to prove this thesis we would need to obtain data on the number of teachers per school. 

2. Schools that had a budget per student of $585-$630 out performed all the other schools with budgets greater or smaller. This looks like a significant category to explore as it may indicate a 'sweet spot' for budgeting on future school developments.
